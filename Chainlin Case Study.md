# Chainlink Case Study
***by Matt Epler*** <br/> <br/>

Blockchain technology was first introduced by Bitcoin, a revolutionary peer to peer digital cash system. As bitcoin only focuses on one use case, Ethereum was birthed in 2013, to expand upon potential blockchain applications. Vitalik Buterin and the team at Ethereum introduced Solidity, a Turing-complete programming language allowing for universal computation. With the world of applications introduced by Ethereum, an important "Oracle Problem" came to light. The revolutionary decentralizing aspects of blockchain technology could not reach their full potential without being coupled with decentralized data feeds.

Blockchain networks naturally only have access to native on-chain data, and must rely on an API or data feed to truly broaden applications. If Ethereum is to be the next base layer for financial activities in the real world, we need real data feeds we can trust. Centralized oracle solutions were originally introduced to address this problem. The problem with centralized oracle solutions is that reintroducing this single point of failure damaged the decentralized aspects of the underlying network. Along comes Chainlink, with a decentralized solution to solve the oracle problem. Chainlink has seen an explosion in usage and valuation throughout the last year, fueled by the summer's DeFi hype. Here is why Chainlink is so important.

The exploding use of public blockchains, increasingly highlighted the demand for external data on-chain. SmartContract, ChainLink's parent company originally created a centralized oracle solution, which created the mentioned oracle problem. To truly bridge the gap between blockchains and real-world activities, we needed oracle solutions in a decentralized fashion. Chainlink was the proposed solution to this problem and raised $32 million through an ICO in September 2017. The team is led by CEO Sergey Nazarov and CTO Steve Ellis.

#### Initial Token Offering Terns

Here you can see the ICO consisted of 3 seperate allocations. 35% of the total supply (1 Billion) was distrbuted during the token sale, which raised $32 million. Another 35% was reserved for the incentivization of node operators, and the final 30% reserved by Chainlink for future development. Since its initial ICO funding, Chainlink has steadily grown in unique wallet addresses and continues to make partnerships. They have one of the most dedicated communities in the space dubbed the "Link Marines". What makes this commmunity so militant?

As blockchain usage continues to scale and grow in adoption, the demand for external data on chain will grow as quickly, if not at a higher rate. This can only mean that the oracle space will continue to be a critical sector of the crypto markets. Chainlink is hoping to maintain its position at the tip of the spear with its $LINK token.


## $LINK Token Utility

Chainlink node operators retrieve data from external (off-chain) 
sources, and put this data on-chain in a readable format for the smart contract. When any entity wants to retrieve external data for smart-contract usage, they are required to compensate node operators in $LINK token. This provided use case highlights, along with the overall growth of the blockchain world as a whole, the potential high ceiling of demand for Chainlink's ERC20 token $LINK. In the future, as more and more data is put on-chain, more and more $LINK tokens will be utilized. If Chainlink can remain the leading facilitator, the token will inevitably grow in value. 

## Expanding Partnerships

Chainlink boasts an extensive list of 377 partnerships and integrations. They are dominating the oracle sector and continue to expand upon their network's potential. A November 2020 article titled "77 Smart Contract Use Cases Enabled by Chainlink", offers a growing list of the many things Chainlink is supporting. The token has also steadily grown in number of unique addresses, with Bloxy.info reporting 350,000+ unique holders. Since the token was launched in late 2017, the number of token holders has grown at an increasingly higher rate in what looks like the beginning of a parabola. Another encouraging sign is that the largest wallet addresses have been accumulating the $LINK token, as opposed to dumping on newer investors. 

Being a "decentralized" orcale network, one of the biggest advantages Chainlink has is the trust that they have built within the crypto space. As they continue to integrate with new projects and work with current partners this trust can be amplified and could cement Chainlink's position as the leading oracle solution. 

## ***How does Chainlink work?***
- - -
In simplest terms, Chainlink is providing smart contracts with external data they otherwise wouldn't have access to. When there is a data request from a smart contract, nodes on the LINK network retrieve the requested data, nodes then come to consensus and agree upon a single value, which is relayed to the requesting contract. <br/> <br/>

<br/> <br/>
This diagram illustrates a simple data request being executed by an Oracle Contract. Smart contracts relying on traditional centralized oracles rely on a single oracle to communicate data, bringing back a single point of failure. Chainlink takes a different approach. Chainlink's model addresses this problem with what's called "source and oracle distribution".
* Source distribution means oracles can draw their data from multiple sources to maintain a good reputation. 
* Oracle distribution means that requests made to the Chainlink network are contracted to several oracles.

This distrbuted method of consensus allows node operators to hold other nodes accountable, and prevent false data outputs. As highlighted before, the data feeds provided are crucial for blockchains to enable real world assets being reflected on-chain. Chainlink is helping Ethereum grow to host the variety of applications the DeFi world promises, but not without competition.


## Competing Oracles

In the oracle sector as a whole, theres more than a dozen competitors, the most well known being $BAND, $API3, $DIA, and $ORAI. While some of these projects may offer innovations, Chainlink could maintain status as "the" oracle, similar to Ethereum's seat as "the" smart contract platform. When looking at competitor market caps, no project comes close to rivaling Chainlink's fully diluted valuation of more than $24 Billion, the closest being Band Protocol at < $1 Billion. Even with new technological innovations introduced by smaller sized oracles, Chainlink has maintained its dominance. 

## ***DeFi on the rise***

##### Total Value locked in DeFi February 2020 - Janauary 2021, currently sitting at $26.1 Billion <br/> <br/>

DeFi (Decentralized Finance) has exploded in value over the last twelve months. Financial applications running on the Ethereum blockchain started to gain real tracton as total value locked went parabolic. After a cool-down in the late fall, the DeFi ecosystem could be primed for another rally. Other leaders in the DeFi space such as Synthetix ($SNX) and Aave ($AAVE) have already taken off again, both up more than 600% since their November lows. Chainlink on the other hand, has just recently broken its all time high set back in August. Although they were certainly not quiet during the summer, they may have slipped back under some radars. Optimism is very high for the future of DeFi and who better than Chainlink to provide their stamp of approval for smart contract data security.


## Results
- - -
Chainlink continues to gain adoption and recognition as the most trusted and used oracle network in the space. They consistently make partnerships, and do a great job getting the word out to their community through hefty marketing campaigns. Some notable non-blockchain-centric partnerships include Google and the payment-processor mammoth SWIFT. Also Grayscale, the firm arguably leading the recent wave of institutional investors, recently made a trust allowing investors to get price exposure to $LINK, alongside a select few tokens. Everyday more and more real world assets and data are being put on-chain, thanks to the decentralized data feeds powered by Chainlink. Without any major data feed failures, Chainlink will likely maintain its spot at the top of the sector. 

## Final Thoughts
- - -
Although Chainlink seems to keep up with the industry, it's
important they stay on the bleeding edge of development. A hot oracle project as of late named API3, has an insurance service built into their network. Insurance has only recently become a popular topic, but Chainlink should ensure they are staying on top of the popular trends. As we continue diving further into the digital world, we need to insure a proper data bridge. In order to bring whole financial ecosystems onto Ethereum, or other smart contract platforms, we must be able to trust the data. That is why Chainlink's decentralized oracle network provides such an essential use case. Partnered with token utility
and one of the strongest communities in the space, Chainlink should be set up for a massive future. This space is inherently risky and using data feeds that people feel they can trust will push us in the right direction towards fully open ecosystems.
